## Overview

### The challenge

This app uses Node.js to dynamically create a professional looking README file. The app is run from the command line with the following command 'node index.js'. It utilizes the Inquirer package to generate the node modules.

### User Story

AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

## My process

### Built with

- Javascript
- Node.js


### What I learned

This project introduced me to new waters, trouble waters, I may add. I learned to initialize and work with a few packages of Node.js. I will continue to build more apps and streamline my code to build mastery. 

### Useful resource

- [Github Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - I used this resource to really understand the components of a README file and how to write markdown.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to TA Scott Nelson for helping me make sense of the source code and integrating it with my node app. I also owe appreciation to my initial grader who challenged me to understand markups and properly document a README. That challenge led me to discover the Github documentation on creating a README. 

Of course, much appreciation to my classmate and study body, Nolan Spence, for guidance on this project.
